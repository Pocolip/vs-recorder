## Technical Considerations for Web App Development

### Data Source APIs

#### Pokepaste Integration
- **URL Format**: `https://pokepast.es/{unique-id}` (e.g., `https://pokepast.es/ae3a60c6c5f40484`)
- **Raw Data Endpoint**: Append `/raw` to any Pokepaste URL to get machine-readable format
  - Example: `https://pokepast.es/ae3a60c6c5f40484/raw`
- **Implementation**: Create a parser to extract team data from the raw text format

#### Pokemon Showdown Replay Integration
- **URL Format**: `https://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/{format}-{battle-id}-{auth-string}`
  - Example: `https://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/gen9vgc2025regi-2348427947-3phjt0i9miwbtlnwom948cv8w7dt5f8pw`
- **API Endpoints**:
  - JSON Format: Append `.json` to replay URLs
  - Log Format: Append `.log` to replay URLs
- **Documentation**: Showdown API details available on [GitHub](https://github.com/smogon/pokemon-showdown-client/blob/master/WEB-API.md)
- **Implementation**: Create parsers for both JSON and log formats to extract battle data
